# Polymorph-lib

This is a header-only library that provides various functionality for randomization on compile-time, in a convenient to use manner that is easy to integrate.

This is *not* a polymorphic code engine, but it takes inspiration from the concept of polymorphic code. You can, however, simulate a polymorphic code engine by recompiling your program each time you would like to run it.

## Use-cases

* binary fingerprinting -- you could distribute a different but equivalent binary to multiple people, and keep track of who received what binary. If your binary becomes leaked, you can trace the leaker back using the original binary.
* signature evasion -- signatures can be generated by hashing files or memory. Code that involves compile-time randomization can evade signature detection between different compiles
* experimentation -- it can be useful to ensure that different permutations of code are equivalent through random sampling, as can be done with this
