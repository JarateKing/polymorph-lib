# Polymorph-lib

This is a header-only library that provides various functionality for randomization on compile-time.

This is *not* a polymorphic code engine, but it takes inspiration from the concept of polymorphic code. You can, however, simulate a polymorphic code engine by recompiling your program each time you would like to run it.
